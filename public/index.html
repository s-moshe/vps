        <h2>Setting the Stage for History</h2>

        <p><strong>What does it take to dominate English football for four straight years?</strong> In a league as competitive as the Premier League, <strong>no team had ever won four consecutive titles</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>But their journey was anything but predictable. <strong>Each season presented a different battle</strong>â€”from sluggish starts to dominant streaks, all while facing relentless competition and nail-biting finishes.</p>
        
        <p>As we relive key moments from Cityâ€™s previous three title-winning seasons, weâ€™ll contrast them with where they stood at the same point in their <strong>2023-24 campaign</strong>â€”their fourth consecutive championshipâ€”<strong>shown in real time on the graph to the right</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> During <strong>week nine</strong> of the <strong>2020-21 season</strong>â€”their first of four consecutive titlesâ€”Manchester City sat in <strong>13th place</strong>. No one would have predicted they would go on to win the <strong>Premier League</strong>, let alone accomplish a historic feat over the next four years. But December of that year marked a turning point, as they launched an <strong>incredible 21-game winning streak</strong> that culminated in a <strong>championship</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, fast forward to <strong>week nine</strong> of the <strong>2023-24 season</strong> (shown in graph to the right)â€”<strong>a very different story</strong>. While not in first, City shows they are a force to be reckoned with right off the bat.</p>

<p><strong>Hover over Manchester City's logo on the right</strong> to compare their position with where they stood in <strong>2020-21</strong>. As a fun extra, hover over the 13th-place teamâ€”<strong>who's struggling now?</strong></p>

     -->

     <p>By<strong> week 15</strong> of the <strong>2023-24 season</strong>, City had fallen to fourth place (shown right)â€”<strong>less than ideal for a team chasing history.</strong></p>

<p>But a look back at the <strong>2021-22 season</strong>, their second consecutive title, paints a very different picture. During <strong>week 15 of 2021-22</strong>, Manchester City had climbed to first placeâ€”<strong>a position they never let go of for the rest of the season.</strong></p>

<p>However, that season was not as easy as that statistic might suggest. On the final day of the season, City trailed 2-0 to Aston Villaâ€”<strong>just 20 minutes away from losing the title.</strong> But in a stunning turn of events, they <strong>scored three goals in five minutes</strong> to secure the trophy. Those three miracle goals remain one of the most dramatic endings in Premier League history.</p>

        <h2>Down to the Wireâ€¦ Again</h2>
        <p>During the second-to-last week of the <strong>2023-24 season</strong> (shown right), Manchester City was yet again in another must-win situation, with <strong>less than a one-game lead over Arsenal</strong>. The equation was simple: <strong>win and make history, or don't and lose that chanceâ€”possibly forever</strong>.</p>

        <p>This was a stark contrast to <strong>2022-23</strong>, where Manchester City won the league with a comfortable eight-point cushion. However, that season too was no cakewalk. Arsenal led the league for a historic 248 daysâ€”the <strong>longest ever for a team that did not win the title</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Fast forward to 2023-24, and City once again face a tense final week. Can they hold on, <strong>or will history slip through their fingers?</strong></p>

        <h2>History Is Made</h2>

<p>When the whistle blew on the last match of the <strong>2023-24 season</strong>, Manchester City had done itâ€”they became <strong>the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive titles</strong>. What made this even more impressive was just how distinct all four of these championships were, with each containing their own unique battles and challenges.</p>

<p>In <strong>2020-21</strong>, they fought back from a <strong>slow start</strong>. In <strong>2021-22</strong>, they controlled the league but still narrowly avoided defeat. In <strong>2022-23</strong>, they hunted down a runaway Arsenal. And now, in <strong>2023-24</strong>, they proved that even under historical pressure, they could still find a way to prevail.</p>

<p>Their record-breaking feat cemented them as <strong>one of the greatest teams in football history</strong>, and their era of success will be remembered not just for the trophies, <strong>but for how they won them</strong>â€”with resiliency, and an ability to always rise to the occasion.</strong></p>

    <h2>Pep Guardiola: The Architect of This Greatness</h2>
    <p>
      The mastermind behind Manchester Cityâ€™s historic four-year title run is Pep Guardiola. When he arrived in 2016, City had already won the Premier League, but Pep wanted moreâ€”not just to win, but to dominate. And thatâ€™s exactly what they did, securing four consecutive league titles and etching their name into football history.
    </p>
    <!-- Pep Guardiola's Image -->
    <img src="images/guardiola.png" alt="Pep Guardiola" class="guardiola-image">
    <p>
      Guardiolaâ€™s philosophyâ€”possession-based, high-pressing, and tactically fluidâ€”became Cityâ€™s identity. He reshaped the squad, bringing in players like Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Ruben Dias, and Erling Haaland, each adding a unique piece to the puzzle. By the time their title streak began, City were a machine, capable of outthinking and outplaying any opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepâ€™s tactical genius was on full display every season. Whether it was inverted full-backs, midfield rotations, or game-changing substitutions, he always found a way to stay ahead. The challenges were thereâ€”tight races, fierce rivals, moments of doubtâ€”but Guardiolaâ€™s ability to keep his squad focused and motivated never wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2023-24 season sealed their legacy, making City the first team to win four straight Premier League titles. But Guardiolaâ€™s impact goes beyond trophies. He built a culture of excellence, defined by his attention to detail, adaptability, and relentless pursuit of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      From thrilling comebacks to displays of dominance, Cityâ€™s four-year run will be remembered as one of footballâ€™s greatest eras. And at the center of it all was Pep Guardiolaâ€”the architect of their success.
